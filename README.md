## 1.Overview of the statistical analysis:

The purpose of the analysis is to biuld along with Kate a solid case to search for the investment of an angel investor to try to implement a shared bike bunisess similar to NYC Citi Bike but in Des Moines, Iova.

The first step is to understand how it actually works in NY since mechanics to make this business work in Iowa could be very different. 

To build our analisys visualization and presentartion we will use Tableu and for the information of the analysis Kate suggests to use Citi Bike data that has been released to the public on their web page. 

## 2.Results:

### Rides, Gender Break Down and Location

- The total of rides of Agust '19 was of 2,3 million rides, this means acceptance and potential
- Regarding Gender, Males are the main users (65%)
- Younger people have longer bike rides
- Top Starting locations are in the most touristic places

- When we break out this times by gender we can see Males (as expected) are the predominant users and also have longer trips than females.

About usage per day and hour we can see that usage on weekends tends to be intense all acrross the day mainly on Sturdays, while on weekdays the usage to commute to work early in the morning (8:00 a.m.รง9 and at the evening have the mayority of the trips, on the afternoon usage is more intense through 5 to 7 p.m.

### 3.Summary:

In a nutshell we can conclude that the potential of taking to iowa the bike sharing plattform could happen if the conditions of Des Moines are similar to NYC: male main users, whoe would subscribe and use it as mean of tranportaiton to work and other daily tasks. Women, as more casual users and lure non subscribers with Starting points as points of interest on the city.

My suggestion of two additioal visualizations would be:

- Starting and Ending points by age group, to capture different markets
- Number of bike of dutty while on maintainance
